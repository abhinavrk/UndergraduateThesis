In this thesis an existing design for a multi-mode Dielectric Grating based Surface Plasmon Resonance (DGSPR) sensor is optimized, with respect to production and operation. To do the optimization, a simulation of the DGSPR structure (written in FORTRAN) was used, and parameters were varied manually, keeping key manufacturing considerations in mind. Due to limitations with regard to computational power, a simple iterative approach was used to perform the optimization. 

Based on the optimized design, a master mold was be fabricated using a mixture of Electron-beam (E-beam) lithography and Deep Reactive Ion Etching (a Pseudo Bosch process). The final DGSPR master mold was examined under an electron microscope to determine the efficacy of the E-beam/DRIE process. The mold was found to have sufficiently smooth side-walls, and to have dimensions within 2\% of the required values. A larger version of the proof-of-concept master mold can be used to repeatedly imprint pieces of $SiO_2$ and hence create as many DGSPR configurations as required.
