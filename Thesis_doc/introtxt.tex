Going forward, based on the optimized design, a master mold will be fabricated using a mixture of Electron-beam (E-beam) lithography and Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE). Additionally, a wet-etch (KOH) will be used to smooth out surfaces if required. The final DGSPR master mold will be examined under a electron microscope to determine the efficacy of the E-beam/DRIE process. If the mold is sufficiently smooth, it can be used to repeatedly imprint pieces of $SiO_2$ and hence create as many DGSPR configurations as required.
